Final Project – Code First Girls: JavaScript Kickstarter Course

## 🎓 About the Course

This project was created as the final assignment for the **Code First Girls - JavaScript Kickstarter** course. Over several weeks, we learned the basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, events, and interactive design—all of which came together in this collaborative project.

## 🧠 Project Idea

We built an **interactive website** that tailors its content based on the **user's age group**. Our goal was to make learning fun and engaging using:

- 🐻 **Animal icons**
- 🔢 **Number visualization**
- 🎵 **Audio feedback**
- ✨ **Hover animations**

## 👶👧👩 Age-Based Experience

Depending on the age entered by the user, the site changes dynamically to offer:

| Age Group | Experience |
|----------|------------|
| 3–6 years | Bright animal icons, simple numbers, playful sounds |
| 7–12 years | More complex interactivity, numbers up to 20 |

## 🎨 Features

- ✅ JavaScript-based DOM updates
- ✅ Hover effects using CSS transitions
- ✅ Custom audio cues for each animal
- ✅ Responsive layout for tablets and desktops
- ✅ Age-based UI and logic separation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- Audio: `<audio>` tags and event listeners
- Animations: `:hover`, `transform`, and JS-based class toggles

## 💡 What We Learned

- Capturing and validating user input
- Updating content dynamically with JS
- Working with audio in the browser
- Structuring a project as a team
- Writing cleaner, reusable code
